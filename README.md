# Watch EPA Superfund Sites
This repo uses GitHub actions to automatically scrape the list of Superfund sites from the EPA website every day and store the results.

This repo uses the same datasource as [the EPA Superfund list page](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/search-superfund-sites-where-you-live).
